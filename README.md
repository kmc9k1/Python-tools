*email_scraper.py* is, as its name implies, a simple email scraping tool. It utilizes BeautifulSoup and is similar in concept to the well known scraping tool TheHarvester.

  <summary><b>keylogger.py</b></summary>
  <p>
  

*keylogger.py* is a very simple keylogger that searches for input with the 'pynput' library and writes to a file that you can specify by editing the 'path' variable. It can be altered for use on Windows or Linux but is mainly aimed at Windows targets. For use in Windows, you must compile it by using Pyinstaller and the command "pyinstaller keylogger.py --onefile --noconsole" to turn it into an executable.
